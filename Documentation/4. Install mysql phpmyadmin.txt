First, create a PHP workspace so you have PHP, MySQL, and Apache installed right away. You can then make sure you have MySQL installed by running:

mysql-ctl install

Then install phpMyAdmin:

phpmyadmin-ctl install

After the installation is complete youâ€™ll just want to make sure mysql is running once more:

mysql-ctl start
